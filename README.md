#App Recommender

An micro project from BitTiger that I am currently working on. 

The project builds a recommendation modules in Python and calculates the top 5 recommendeded apps for users based on their download history.

Test data are originally provided by BitTiger in two .json files: app_info.json and user_download_history.json.

Cosine similarity is used for calculating the similarity between two lists of app.
