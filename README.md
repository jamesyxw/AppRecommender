#App Recommender

An micro project from BitTiger that I am currently working on. 

The project builds a recommendation modules in Python and calculate the top 5 recommendeded apps for users based on their download history.

Test data are originally provided by BitTiger in two .json files. MongoDB is used to store the data for local usage. 

Cosine similarity is used calculate the similarity between two lists of app.
